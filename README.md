# CPU-Dasher-for-iOS
CPU Dasher for iOS source code. It only supports ARMv7 and ARMv7s architectures.

CPU Dasher is a smart app that shows a lot of information for all the Apple A processors in 32-bit mode. It lists the device info, CPU info, almost all the AArch32 ARM instruction set(including general-purpose instructions and NEON & VFP instructions) and the performance of several common algorithms, such as matrix multiplication, color-to-gray image processing etc.

If you want to build the source, remove arm64 architecture in Xcode.
